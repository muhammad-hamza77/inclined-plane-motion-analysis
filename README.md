# Inclined Plane Motion Analysis â€“ Engineering Mechanics Lab (OEL)

This project investigates how the steepness of an inclined plane affects the motion (speed, acceleration, and velocity) of rolling objects such as a toy car, ball, and cylinder. Calculations include theoretical vs. practical values using Newtonian mechanics, energy equations, and time-based measurements.

ðŸ“„ Includes full observations, formulas, graphs, and error analysis.
